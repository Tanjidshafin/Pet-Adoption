Hello this is Tanjid Karim Shafin From Batch 10 Mission Web Developement Course.. This is the readme of my assignment number 6th i will included everything i done with my assignment. First OF All 
1. MY Project was a Website where any one can adopt one or more pets, So i gave title about my website to "PetHouse".
2. This website connects potential pet owners with animals in need of a loving home. It provides detailed profiles of adoptable pets, including their breed, Birth, Gender,Price and health status, to help users find the perfect match. This often features photos and background information on each pet, along with tools to filter by its prices.
3. I have added a loading animation when clicking any categories button or sort by price button
4. I have given two modals one is for knowing the details of the pets and another is for ther adoption process of a pet , but the fact is adoption process modal closes automatically after 3 seconds.
5. when clicking a pets like button, the image of the pet shows inside of a blank area but only 8 pics can be liked at a time.
6. i have given a button named Sort by price which allows user show the prices of the pets in the descending order of the prices
7. When i click the view more button, the website redirects user to the Best deal for you Page.
8. I have used the arrow function ES6 features which helped me to complete my assignment quite faster.
